# OpenCV based face ID bio metric system

This is a full implemenation of bio-metric identification system which uses openCv based face id algorithm for setting up a Face ID recognition. This code base :-

    

This code base contains -
1. User Interface
2. Java based control system
3. OpenCV based Face ID Mechanism
    > Applies various approach under openCV for implemenation
    > Front end app for data collection and trainning
    > On the go training system for models
    > On the go face Id which uses face id to pull user data from the system.
